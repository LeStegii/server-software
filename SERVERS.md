# Servers
Minecraft servers make it possible to play minecraft in multiplayer. Some versions allow the use of mods or plugins.
The softwares are split into **Plugins** and **Mods**, all softwares in the **Mods** category support playing with Fabric or Forge mods.
The versions that are listed are the ones that you can download officially without visiting some weird sites.
